# SUI Blockchain Architecture

The architecture of the SUI blockchain is designed to provide scalability, security, and efficiency. This section explores the key components and design principles of the SUI blockchain architecture.

## Key Components

### Nodes
- **Full Nodes:** Participate in consensus, validate transactions, and maintain the entire blockchain.
- **Light Nodes:** Validate transactions and maintain only part of the blockchain, typically for efficiency.

### Ledger Structure
- **Blocks:** Container data structures that include multiple transactions.
- **Transactions:** Individual operations recorded on the blockchain, including transfers and smart contract executions.

### Virtual Machine
- **SUI Virtual Machine (SVM):** Executes smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) with efficiency and security.

## Design Principles

### Modularity
- **Layered Architecture:** Separates different concerns into distinct layers, such as the networking layer, consensus layer, and application layer.
- **Pluggable Components:** Allows for the replacement or upgrading of individual components without affecting the entire system.

### Scalability
- **Sharding:** Divides the blockchain into shards to handle more transactions simultaneously.
- **Layer 2 Solutions:** Implements off-chain solutions to increase transaction throughput and reduce latency.

### Security
- **Cryptographic Techniques:** Uses advanced cryptographic methods to ensure data integrity and confidentiality.
- **Formal Verification:** Ensures that smart contracts and protocols are mathematically proven to be correct.

## System Workflow

### Transaction Lifecycle
1. **Creation:** A transaction is created by a user or smart contract.
2. **Broadcasting:** The transaction is broadcasted to the network.
3. **Validation:** Nodes validate the transaction against consensus rules.
4. **Inclusion:** Validated transactions are included in the next block.
5. **Finality:** The block is added to the blockchain, and the transaction is considered final.

### Consensus Process
- **Proposal:** Nodes propose new blocks based on received transactions.
- **Voting:** Nodes vote on proposed blocks using the consensus algorithm.
- **Finalization:** Once a block receives enough votes, it is finalized and added to the blockchain.

The architecture of the SUI blockchain is designed to support robust, secure, and scalable decentralized applications. For more technical details, refer to the [SUI Blockchain Whitepaper](./09_SUI_Blockchain_Whitepaper.md).
