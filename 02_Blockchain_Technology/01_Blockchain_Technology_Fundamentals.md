# Blockchain Technology Fundamentals

Blockchain technology is a revolutionary innovation that underpins cryptocurrencies and many decentralized applications. This section covers the fundamental concepts and structures that make up blockchain technology.

## Key Concepts

### Ledger
- **Distributed Ledger:** A type of database spread across multiple sites, regions, or participants.
- **Immutable Records:** Once data is written on a blockchain, it cannot be altered retroactively.

### Blocks
- **Block Structure:** Contains a list of transactions, a timestamp, and a reference to the previous block.
- **Block Hash:** A unique identifier generated using a cryptographic hash function.

### Transactions
- **Transaction Data:** Represents a transfer of value or information within the blockchain.
- **Validation:** Transactions are verified by network nodes through consensus mechanisms.

### Nodes
- **Full Nodes:** Store the entire blockchain and validate transactions and blocks.
- **Light Nodes:** Store only a subset of the blockchain and rely on full nodes for validation.

### Consensus Mechanisms
- **Proof of Work (PoW):** Requires nodes to solve complex mathematical puzzles.
- **Proof of Stake (PoS):** Validators are chosen based on the number of tokens they hold and are willing to "stake."

## Blockchain Types

### Public Blockchains
- **Open to Everyone:** Anyone can join and participate in the network.
- **Examples:** Bitcoin, Ethereum.

### Private Blockchains
- **Restricted Access:** Only specific users have permission to participate.
- **Examples:** Hyperledger, Corda.

### Consortium Blockchains
- **Hybrid Model:** Controlled by a group of organizations rather than a single entity.
- **Examples:** Quorum, R3 Corda.

Understanding these fundamentals is crucial for anyone looking to explore or work in the blockchain space. For further reading, refer to the [Additional Resources](../01_Introduction/10_Additional_Resources.md) section.
