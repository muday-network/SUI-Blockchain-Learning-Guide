# Consensus Algorithms

Consensus algorithms are protocols that ensure all nodes in a blockchain network agree on the state of the ledger. This section covers the major consensus algorithms used in blockchain technology.

## Proof of Work (PoW)
- **Mechanism:** Miners compete to solve cryptographic puzzles; the first to solve the puzzle adds the next block to the blockchain.
- **Advantages:** Secure and well-tested.
- **Disadvantages:** High energy consumption and slower transaction times.
- **Examples:** Bitcoin, Litecoin.

## Proof of Stake (PoS)
- **Mechanism:** Validators are chosen based on the number of tokens they hold and are willing to "stake."
- **Advantages:** More energy-efficient than PoW.
- **Disadvantages:** Can lead to centralization if a few entities hold large stakes.
- **Examples:** Ethereum 2.0, Cardano.

## Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)
- **Mechanism:** Token holders vote for a small number of delegates who validate transactions and maintain the blockchain.
- **Advantages:** High throughput and low latency.
- **Disadvantages:** Less decentralized and can be more susceptible to corruption.
- **Examples:** EOS, TRON.

## Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)
- **Mechanism:** Nodes communicate with each other to agree on the next block, assuming some nodes may fail or act maliciously.
- **Advantages:** High efficiency and fast transactions.
- **Disadvantages:** Limited scalability and high communication overhead.
- **Examples:** Hyperledger Fabric, Zilliqa.

## Proof of Authority (PoA)
- **Mechanism:** Validators are pre-approved and trusted entities who create new blocks.
- **Advantages:** High performance and scalability.
- **Disadvantages:** Centralized control and reduced security.
- **Examples:** VeChain, POA Network.

## Other Consensus Algorithms
- **Proof of Burn:** Participants burn (destroy) coins to gain the right to mine.
- **Proof of Capacity:** Participants use their hard drive space to mine blocks.
- **Proof of Elapsed Time:** Uses trusted hardware to ensure blocks are produced in a fair manner.

Each consensus algorithm has its strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different use cases. For an in-depth comparison, refer to the [Additional Resources](../01_Introduction/10_Additional_Resources.md) section.
