# Blockchain Standards

Standards are essential for ensuring interoperability, security, and functionality in blockchain technology. This section covers the key blockchain standards and their importance.

## Key Standards

### Token Standards
- **ERC-20:** Standard for fungible tokens on Ethereum.
- **ERC-721:** Standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Ethereum.
- **BEP-20:** Token standard on Binance Smart Chain, compatible with ERC-20.

### Interoperability Standards
- **Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC):** Standard for cross-chain communication in the Cosmos ecosystem.
- **Atomic Swap Protocols:** Standards for direct cross-chain exchanges.

### Security Standards
- **ISO/TC 307:** International standards for blockchain and distributed ledger technologies.
- **NIST Guidelines:** National Institute of Standards and Technology guidelines for blockchain security.

## Standardization Bodies
