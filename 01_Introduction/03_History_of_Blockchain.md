# History of Blockchain

Blockchain technology has evolved significantly since its inception. This section provides a brief history of its development and key milestones.

## Key Milestones

### Pre-Bitcoin Era
- **1991:** Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta proposed a cryptographically secure chain of blocks.
- **1998:** Computer scientist Nick Szabo developed the concept of "bit gold," a precursor to Bitcoin.
